        <h1>2018 Central Park Squirrel Census</h1>
        <p>From October 6 to October 20, 2018, volunteers swarmed the parks of New York and recorded all squirrels in sight. Metrics included fur color, height at which squirrel was seen if above ground, what number that squirrel was recorded during a session of census reporting, and when they recorded each squirrel.
